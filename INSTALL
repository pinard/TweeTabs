There is a reachable copy of my own sandbox repository for TweeTabs.  To
get and install your own copy, try these commands:

   git clone git://tweetabs.progiciels-bpi.ca/tweetabs
   cd tweetabs
   python setup.py install

The author reserves the right of happily tampering with the Git history
and resetting branches at any time â€” users may then have to re-clone.
Moreover, if the Git clone server does not respond, just tell me and
I'll restart it.
