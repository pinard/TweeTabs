The TweeTabs project aims the production of yet another Twitter reader,
including machinery for personal management of Twitter lists.

This project implements a generic tool for handling sets, each
represented with a notebook tab.  The graphical user interface allows
the user to define tabs as function of other tabs through usual
operations on sets, complemented by a few other interactive facilities.
This framework is then particularized into a Tweeter reader, and the tab
operations help the user at managing Twitter overall.
